I have adapted this algorithm from http://forums.elysianshadows.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=5767
(thanks to the user N64vSNES). I'm still struggling to understand the check on the if that's 
indicated with the [NO UNDERSTAND!!!] but i guess this works fine. :-)
All comments on this algorithm were made by N64vSNES on his thread post (link above).
